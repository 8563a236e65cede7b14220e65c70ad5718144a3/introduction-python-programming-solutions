1)  A programming language is a computer language engineered to communicate instructions to a machine.

2)  - Go to anaconda site
    - Download 64bit linux installation script
    - Bash <script.sh>
    - Add to (front) of path

3)  - Go to JetBrains website
    - Download Linux tar.gz
    - extract
    - add to front of path
    - create desktop launcher

4)  Advantages:
        - can execute very fast
        - programs can efficiently utilise memory
    Disadvantages:
        - almost impossible for humans to use because it consists entirely of numbers
        - hard to maintain and debug
        - no mathematical functions available
        - memory locations are manipulated directly, requiring the programmer to keep track of every memory location

5)  Programs are used in many places like supermarkets, banks, ... and provide invaluable services

6)  Advantages:
        - Easier to modify, faster to write code and debug as it uses English like statements
        - Portable code, as it is designed to run on multiple machines
    Disadvantages:
        - Not as fast or memory efficient
        - Many languages and paradigms to choose from

7)  - Dates back to late 1980s
    - Started in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum
    - design philosophy emphasizes code readability
    - syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code
    - multiparadigm
    - Python 1.0 released in 1991
    - Python 2.0 released October 200
    - Python 3.0 released December 2008

8)  - A compiler is a system software program that transforms high-level source code written by a software developer in a high-level language into a low level machine language.
    - Compilers translate source code all at once and the computer then executes the machine language that the compiler produced.
    - The generated machine language can be later executed many times against different data each time

    - An interpreter is a program that reads source code one statement at a time, translates the statement into machine language, executes the machine language statement, then continues with the next statement.

9)  - There are no symbolic names for memory locations
    - It is difficult to read
    - Assembly language is machine-dependent making it difficult for portability

10) - Planning of Project
        - Total number of resources required to implement this project is determined by estimating the cost and size of the software product.
    - Analysis and Requirement Gathering
        - Maximum amount of information is collected from the client about the kind of software product he desires
    - Design
        - Analyses whether the software can be implemented with all the features as specified by the client.
    -Development
        - Start building the software according to the design document
    - Testing
        - Tested against the requirements specified by the client to ensure the product is working as expected.
    - Deployment
        - Product is released to the client to use after testing the product thoroughly to match the requirements of the client
    - Maintenance
        - Taking care of the developed and deployed software product.

11) Software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify and enhance.

12) - Apache
    - BSD
    - GNU GPL
    - MIT
    - Creative Commons
