Encapsulation
    Encapsulation is the process of combining variables that store
    data and methods that work on those variables into a single
    unit called a class.
    In Encapsulation, the variables are not accessed directly,
    it is accessed through the methods present in the class.
    Encapsulation ensures that the object's internal representation
    (its state and behaviour) are hidden from the rest of the
    application.
    Thus, encapsulation makes the concept of data hiding possible.
    Data hiding means that in order to access data stored in a variable
    everybody MUST use the methods that are provided, so that
    they are the same for everybody
    An application using a class does not need to know its internal
    workings or how it is implemented.
    The program simply creates an object and uses it to invoke
    the methods of that class.
    Abstraction is a process where you show only "relevant" variables
    that are used to access data and "hide" implementation details of
    an object from the user.
        Encapsulation -> Information Hiding
        Abstraction -> Implementation Hiding
