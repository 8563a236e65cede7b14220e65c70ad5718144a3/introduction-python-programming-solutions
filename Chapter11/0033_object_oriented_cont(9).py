The Polymorphism
    Poly means many and morphism means forms
    Polymorphism is one of the tenets of Object Oriented Programming.
    Polymorphism means that you can have multiple classes where each
    class implements the same variables or methods in different ways.
    Polymorphism takes advantage of inheritance to make this happen.
    Duck-typing in Python allows us to use any object that provides
    the required methods and variables without forcing it to belong to
    any particular class.
    In duck-typing an object's suitability is determined by the presence
    of methods and variables rather than the actual type of the object.
    Difference between inheritance and polymorphism is, while inheritance
    is implemented on classes, polymorphism is implemented on methods
