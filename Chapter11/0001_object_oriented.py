Object-Oriented Programming
    Use objects to model real-world things that we want to represent
    inside our programs and provide a simple way to access their
    functionality that would otherwise be hard or impossible to
    utilize.
    As the programs are not disposable, an object-oriented program is
    much easier to modify and maintain than a non-object-oriented program
    Object-oriented programming results in
        code reuse
        cleaner code
        better architecture
        abstraction layers
        fewer programming bugs
    Python provides full support for Object-oriented programming
    including
        Encapsulation
        Inheritance
        Polymorphism

Classes and Objects
    A class is a blueprint from which individual objects are
    created.
    An object is a bundle of related state (variables) and behaviour
    (methods).
    Objects contain variables, which represent the state of information
    about the thing you are trying to model, and the methods represent
    the behaviour or functionality that you want it to have.
    Variables refers both to Instance variables and Class variables

Creating Classes in Python
    class ClassName:
        <statement-1>
        ...
        <statement-N>

    Classes are defined by using the class keyword, followed by
    the ClassName and a colon.
    Class definitions must be executed before they have any effect
    Methods are a special kind of function that is defined within a
    class
